# Full-Wave-Rectification-in-Proteus
simulation circuit of Full Wave Rectification 
In this Project, the Full wave Rectification is done by the Diodes. Thie resultant wav is then modified to a clean and calm wave of the Direct current with the help of transformer. You can check oher interesting projects at www.theengineeringprojects.com .
